This is opentracker. An open bittorrent tracker.

It's a bit modified to collect download statistics from gamenet application. It uses redis backend to store data - `lastUpdated` set with last updated users. And one hset per each user. Hset fields are concatenated string separated by dot - torrent hash, connection id, event name. You may find two special fields - status and time. They used to aggregate data per time. Also we use hset `infohash` to calculate hash => aggregate id information.

You need libowfat (http://www.fefe.de/libowfat/), hiredis client (https://github.com/redis/hiredis) and OpenSSL crypto library (https://www.openssl.org/). If you are going to store dl/ul statistics locally, you need Redis (http://redis.io/) daemon running as well.

Steps to go:

cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.fefe.de:/cvs -z9 co libowfat
cd libowfat
make
cd ..
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.erdgeist.org:/home/cvsroot co opentracker
cd opentracker
make
./opentracker

This tracker is open in a sense that everyone announcing a torrent is welcome to do so and will be informed about anyone else announcing the same torrent. Unless
-DWANT_IP_FROM_QUERY_STRING is enabled (which is meant for debugging purposes only), only source IPs are accepted. The tracker implements a minimal set of
essential features only but was able respond to far more than 10000 requests per second on a Sun Fire 2200 M2 (thats where we found no more clients able to fire
more of our testsuite.sh script).

Some tweaks you may want to try under FreeBSD:

sysctl kern.ipc.somaxconn=1024
sysctl kern.ipc.nmbclusters=32768
sysctl net.inet.tcp.msl=10000
sysctl kern.maxfiles=10240

License information:

Although the libowfat library is under GPL, Felix von Leitner agreed that the compiled binary may be distributed under the same beer ware license as the source code for opentracker. However, we like to hear from happy customers.
